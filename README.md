# PasswordGenerator

***

## An application used to randomly generator user passwords.

***

*Introduction

This application uses javascript to randomly generate a password between 8 and 128 characters. Once generated, the password displays one the webpage. The user can then copy that password with the copy button.

 * This is my first real attempt with Javascript and was part of my learning effort through UNH's Coding Bootcamp
